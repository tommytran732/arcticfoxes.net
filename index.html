				<h1>ArcticFoxes</h1>
				<p>This is a small Matrix homeserver for cool nerds to hang around. Most users are from the <a href="https://privacyguides.org">PrivacyGuides.org</a> community.</p>
				<p><strong>Rules</strong>: Please use common sense, and be a responsible person. Do not post illegal materials, spam, or harrass other people.</p>
				<p><strong>Privacy</strong>: I do not sell your data to third parties. However, I do have the data that every other Matrix homeserver operator has access to, including but not limited to your IP address, who you talk to, how often you message them, which rooms you are in, etc. While I value your privacy, I have zero tolerance for criminal activities such as posting child exploitation materials, planning to cause death or serious physical injury to any person, human trafficking, etc. If caught, you will have your account terminated and your data being forwarded to relevant authorities.</p>
				<p><strong>Hosting</strong>: The server runs on my own hardware with drive encryption and colocated in the UK. Static pages (such as this one) are hosted on <a href="https://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>, but anything dealing with your private data such as the <a href="https://app.arcticfoxes.net">Element web client</a> or the <a href="https://matrix.arcticfoxes.net">API endpoints</a> are not behind their reverse proxy.</p>
